%p Chris Gordon began photography as a teen. She spent many hours in the darkroom throughout High School and College. With the advent of the digital camera, she immersed herself in it once again.
%br  
%p Since then she has travelled to parts of Africa, South America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
%p “I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to see these diverse parts of the world. Meeting interesting people and establishing relationships is a valuable experience.”
%br  
%p She particularly enjoys the challenge of wildlife photography; anything (or nothing!) can happen on any given day. There are no guarantees – which make a sighting, and a captured photograph, all the more special.
%br  
%p Proceeds from the sale of her photographs go toward those in need in the areas she has visited, including: women farmers in Kenya, Bwindi Community Hospital in Southwestern Uganda, orphaned schoolchildren in Nairobi and those fighting to save elephants from poachers in East Africa.
